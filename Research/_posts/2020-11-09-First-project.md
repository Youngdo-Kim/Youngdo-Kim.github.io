title: The Catalyst for My Research Career

<div class="message">
My first research started in high school with a question that arose while trying to stop a nosebleed at the sink: why does the Worthington jet created by falling blood droplets exhibit a consistent directionality? As I delved into this topic, I realized that my academic foundation was insufficient for fully grasping the phenomenon and appreciating the beauty of fluid dynamics. Therefore, I chose to pursue mechanical engineering to deepen my knowledge of fluid dynamics. Along the way, I also set a goal to conduct research as a lead author. After six years of endeavor, I achieved both aspirations. My research journey, driven by curiosity and passion, will continue.

<h2> Research 6. <br> Symmetry breaking of Worthington jets by gradients in liquid pool depth </h2>
Published as a co-author, Physics of Fluids (2020/11)
<br>In this project, I focused primarily on <strong>idea conceptualization</strong>, <strong>experimental design</strong>, and <strong>qualitative analysis</strong>.

When a droplet falls into a bath on an asymmetric substrate, it consistently bounces back toward the shallow side. This phenomenon can be broken down into three main stages. The first stage is the cavity formation stage, where a crater forms symmetrically, similar to the dimple created on a symmetric substrate.

    The second stage is the cavity collapse stage. When the cavity reaches the maximum diameter, a capillary wave propagates through the dimple surface and the cavity starts to collapse. Under the assumption of small amplitude waves and linear wave theory, the speed of the capillary wave is proportional to <span style="font-size: smaller;">âˆš</span>(<span style="text-decoration: overline;">tanh(h)</span>), where h is the shortest distance between the cavity surface and the bottom substrate. Consequently, the propagation speed of the capillary wave on the right side is faster than that on the left. This speed difference triggers an inclined jet protrusion due to momentum conservation in the final jet formation stage. We demonstrated that the experimental results align with the trends derived from the model.
