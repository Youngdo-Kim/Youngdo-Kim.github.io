<div class="message">
As environmental pollution intensifies, interest and research in PM are growing. In these studies, we used DIHM to investigate the dynamics of PM settling on plants and developed a method to measure the concentration of PM suspended in water. As a co-author, I contributed to experiment design and formal analysis, making it a valuable opportunity to learn DIHM technology and supervised machine learning models.

<h2> Research 4. <br><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479723001019">Accelerated settling velocity of airborne PM on hairy plant leaves</a></h2>

Published as a co-author, Journal of Environmental Management (2023/04)<br>In this project, I focused primarily on <strong>formal analysis</strong>.

Perilla (sesame) and pepper leaves, which are widely cultivated in Korea, show differences in terms of trichomes. While the individual trichome sizes of both leaves are similar, the trichomes on perilla leaves are over three times denser, and the surface charge density is measured to be more than five times greater.  Although the PM was dropped from a sufficient distance away from the perilla leaves, allowing enough time to reach terminal velocity, it was observed that its <strong>velocity increased as the PM approached the leaves</strong>. This acceleration is due to the <strong>attraction between the enhanced electronic field</strong> created by the sharp trichomes, <strong>causing the PM velocity to exceed the terminal velocity</strong> of the freely falling PM.

<!--<br>한국에서 많이 재배되는 깻잎과 고추잎은 trichome의 측면에서 큰 차이가 있다. 두 잎은 individual한 trichome size는 비슷하지만 깻잎의 trichome이 3배 이상 빽빽하며 surface charge density도 5배 이상 크게 측정되었다. PM을 깻잎으로부터 충분히 먼 거리에서 낙하시켰기 때문에 종단속도에 진입할 충분한 시간이 제공되었음에도 불구하고, PM이 잎에 낙하하면서 trichome에 가까이 접근할 수록 점점 PM의 속력이 빨라지는 모습을 가시화했다. 그 이유는 뾰족한 trichome에 의해 강화된 전기장과 PM간의 attraction 때문에 자유낙하하는 PM의 종단속도 이상으로 빨라지는 것이다.
Perilla (sesame) and pepper leaves widely cultivated in Korea have large differences with trichomes. Even though the trichome size of both leaves is similar, the number of sesame leaf trichomes is three times denser than the trichome of pepper leaf. Also, the measured surface charged density of the sesame leaf is five times larger than the pepper leaf charge density. Despite PM having enough distance and time to reach settling velocity, DIHM visualized that when the PM reaches closer to the trichome the PM velocity increases. This is because the attraction between the enhanced electronic field created by the sharp trichomes and the PM causes the PM velocity to exceed the terminal velocity of the freely falling PM.-->

<br>The theoretical settling velocity of free-falling PM is reached when drag and gravitational forces are balanced under low-speed conditions, known as Stokes flow. As shown in Figure 4, the theoretical velocity model exhibited a similar order to the measured values. Additionally, it was observed that the velocity of the PM approaching the leaves increased by approximately 3% for perilla leaves and about 6% for pepper leaves compared to when it was relatively farther away. Through this project, I gained experience in optical setup, imaging, reconstruction, and particle tracking using DIHM.
<!--Free falling PM의 theoretical terminal velocity는 저속 조건인 stokes flow에서 drag와 gravitational force가 평형을 이룰때 도달한다. Figure 4를 보면 Theoretical velocity model이 측정 값들과 비슷한 크기 정도를 보였다. 또한 잎에 접근하는 PM이, 잎에서 비교적 떨어진 순간의 속도보다 가까이 접근했을 때 속도가 깻잎은 약 3% 고추잎은 약 6% 정도 더 증가한 것을 관찰했다. Through this project, I gained experience in optical setup, imaging, reconstruction, and particle tracking using DIHM.

        <p>
          This project <strong>aimed to replace expensive conventional PM measuring devices with a smartphone-based solution</strong>. Using DIHM and machine learning, we predicted the PM concentration in a solution containing a mixture of fine PM (1.2 micrometer) and coarse PM (7.6 micrometer). When a light source interacts with an object, it produces fringe patterns, which, when accumulated, form a speckle pattern. These speckle patterns were used to predict the concentrations of coarse and fine PMs through a machine-learning model. This model was trained exclusively on images of single concentrations to <strong>predict the concentrations of coarse and fine PM from images of a polydisperse solution</strong>.

<br>The spatial frequency of the speckle pattern generated by fine PM is generally much higher than that of coarse PM. Consequently, the mixed signal from the polydisperse solution can be separated into fine and coarse PM signals using Gaussian high-pass and low-pass filters. Monodisperse coarse and fine PM samples with known concentrations were passed through these filters before entering each CAE for feature extraction. The extracted features served as inputs for fully connected neural networks to predict the PM concentration in the images. The model was trained to minimize the discrepancy between the predicted PM concentration and the ground truth concentration. While the predictions for fine PM concentrations showed moderate accuracy, the coarse PM concentrations required additional correction factors post-prediction. As for the experimental setup, we developed a device using a smartphone instead of a conventional high-speed camera, creating the entire system for under $400 using a 3D printer and the smartphone.
<!--<br>보통 fine PM의 spatial frequency가 coarse PM의 spatial frequency보다 훨씬 높다. 그래서 우리는 가우시안 high and low pass filter로 mixture의 신호를 분리해서 fine PM과 coarse PM을 예측했다. 농도가 알려진 Monodisperse coarse and fine PM은 각각 low pass filter와 high pass filter를 거친 후에 각 CAE에 들어가서 feature가 추출된다. 추출된 feature는 각 fully connected neural network에 input으로 들어가고 output으로 이미지의 PM 농도를 예측한다. Model은 예측한 PM농도와 ground truth 농도간의 오차를 줄이는 방향으로 학습된다. 학습된 모델은 coarse PM과 fine PM이 섞여있는 solution에서 coarse와 fine PM 농도를 예측한다. Fine PM은 농도예측이 잘 되지만 coarse PM은 예측 후에 추가적인 correction factor로 보정이 필요했다. 이 연구에는 conventional한 DIHM setup이 아니라 camera 대신 smartphone을 사용한 setup을 개발했다. We created the setup for under $400 using a 3D printer and a Samsung smartphone.-->
