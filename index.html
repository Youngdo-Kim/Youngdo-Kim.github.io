      I am an undergraduate student majoring in Mechanical Engineering at
      <a href="https://postech.ac.kr/eng/">Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH)</a>. Currently, I am a research intern at the
      <a href="http://bbrc.postech.ac.kr/">Future Fluid and Biomimetics Laboratory (FFBL)</a>, under the guidance of <a href="https://me.postech.ac.kr/page/professor13_en">Dr. Sang Joon Lee</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      My discovery of a <a href="https://youngdo-kim.github.io/research/2020/11/09/First-project/">physical phenomenon and its principle</a> during my first research project sparked my interest in a research career.
      Throughout this journey, I delved into digital in-line holographic microscopy to obtain depth-wise information through numerical reconstruction and learned to use machine learning.
      The core of my research is a <a href="https://youngdo-kim.github.io/research/2024/03/17/AI-Driven-Enhancements-for-DIHM/">biomedical imaging technique</a> that measures the velocity fields and orientation of red blood cells.
      My current project is a 3D object morphology reconstruction using neural fields and self-supervised learning techniques from a single image.
      <br><br>In addition to these research experiences, I served as an engineer in the Korean Army from December 2022 to June 2024.
      My mission focused on mine clearance operations, Bailey bridge construction, and bridge demolition to thwart enemy maneuvers.
      The experience of detecting landmines on mountainous slopes while wearing a 20-kilogram demining suit has developed a mindset to conquer challenges in the face of potential threats.
      It has also deepened my appreciation for the gift of life I receive every day.
