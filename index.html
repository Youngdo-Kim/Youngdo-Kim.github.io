      <h2> I am Youngdo Kim.</h2>
      I am an undergraduate student majoring in Mechanical Engineering at
      <a href="https://postech.ac.kr/eng/">Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH)</a>. Currently, I am a research intern at the
      <a href="http://bbrc.postech.ac.kr/">Future Fluid and Biomimetics Laboratory (FFBL)</a>, under the guidance of <a href="https://me.postech.ac.kr/page/professor13_en">Sangjoon Lee</a>.
      
    </p>

    <p>
      The joy and fulfillment of elucidating the principles of a <a href="https://youngdo-kim.github.io/research/2020/11/09/First-project/">physical phenomenon</a> I discovered for the first time were enough to lead me to become a researcher.
      <br>Throughout this journey, I delved into DIHM to obtain depth-wise information through numerical reconstruction and learned to use machine learning.
      The core of <a href="https://youngdo-kim.github.io/research/2024/03/15/AI-Driven-Enhancements-for-DIHM/">my research</a> is a biomedical imaging technique that measures the velocity fields and orientation of red blood cells.
      Currently, I am working on 3D object morphology reconstruction from a single image using neural fields and self-supervised learning techniques.
